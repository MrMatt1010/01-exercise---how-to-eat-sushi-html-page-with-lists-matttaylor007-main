    <h1>Eating Sushi Properly</h1>

    <h2><strong>Clean your hands before eating sushi.</strong></h2>
    <p>
      You can wash your hands before eating or your server may give you a hot,
      moist towel to use before your meal is served. Wipe your hands thoroughly
      on the towel and set it back on its plate so your server can take it away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many sushi restaurants will also provide another hot, moist towel for you
      to clean your hands at the end of the meal.
    </p>

   
      <h2><strong>Identify the wasabi and soy sauce. </strong></h2>
      <p> The server or chef will set down the
      plate of sushi you ordered, but you'll also notice a small empty dish,
      which you can pour soy sauce into, and a dab of green paste. The green
      paste is wasabi, which you can eat with the sushi to give it a little
      heat.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Sushi chefs add some wasabi to their rolls, so try the sushi before
        adding wasabi to your pieces.
      </li>

      <li>
        You'll also notice pickled ginger off to the side of the sushi. It will
        be pale or bright pink in color.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
     <h2><stong>Pick up a piece of sushi with chopsticks or your fingers.</stong></h2> 
      <p>Although you
      often see sushi eaten with chopsticks, it is acceptable to pick up a piece
      of sushi with your fingers. Good sushi shouldn't fall apart when you grasp
      it with your fingers or chopsticks
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep in mind that sashimi is usually only eaten with chopsticks. Since
      there's no rice in sashimi, it's pretty easy to pick up the fish with
      chopsticks. 

     <h2><strong> Dip the sushi in soy sauce if you'd like to enhance the flavor of the fish.</strong></h2> 
      
      Pour a little soy sauce into the empty dish on your sushi
      plate. Slowly dip the piece of sushi into the soy sauce for about 1
      second. If you're eating nigiri, tilt the fish into the soy sauce instead
      of the rice so it doesn't fall apart.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Since the chef has already seasoned the sushi, it's considered rude to soak
    an entire piece of sushi in soy sauce. Soaking the piece in soy sauce also
    makes it more likely to fall apart.</li> 
    <li>Try not to mix wasabi into the soy sauce since this is seen as bad manners.</li>
    <li>If the sushi already has sauce on it, eat
    a piece before dipping it in soy sauce. You might enjoy the flavor that the
    chef has already prepared. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2><strong>Try to eat the sushi in one bite.</strong></h2>

    Most sushi is small enough to fit into your mouth all at once. Eating all of the sushi in
    a single bite will allow you to enjoy all of the flavors of the rice,
    wrapper, and fish. If the sushi is too large to fit into your mouth, you can
    eat it in 2 bites, but you may want to let the chef know that you prefer
    smaller pieces.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Although some people argue that you must put the sushi fish-side down in
        your mouth, you can decide which way to eat the piece.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pay attention to how the flavors change as you eat the sushi. For
        example, you might notice a tender texture at first, followed by a
        slightly spicy finish.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><stong>Eat bites of ginger in between different types of sushi to cleanse your
    palate.</stong></h2>

    <p>
      You probably ordered a few types of sushi, so you'll want to taste the
      difference between each of them. To refresh your mouth between different
      types of sushi, use your chopsticks to pick up a slice of ginger. Once
      you've eaten the ginger, you're ready to taste the next sushi.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Avoid draping the ginger on the sushi and eating them together.</li>
      <li>
        Ginger is sometimes pale white or bright pink if food coloring has been
        added.
      </li>
    </ul>
